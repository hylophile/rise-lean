- request: option to type-annotate rexprs which we then check against in the end
- could try eqsat, probably need different substitution data structure. how to substitute there anyways?
- more scalar types (int, f32 ...)
- bool type
- foreign func
- type-level functions
  - dependent pair/array ops
- a way to define functions with an implementation.
- `+-*/^` for nats in expressions, not just types
- makeArray ðŸ¤¯
